# OOPish Calculator
[Live version](https://nathoggles.github.io/calculator/)

Simple yet fully functioning calculator project I did to solidify my JavaScript basics. Its' level of OOPness is admittedly quite light; however, I did treat each calculation as a standartized object consistently, which not only provided me with tranining and challenges, but which also allowed me somewhat distinguish this webapp from countless other calculators: it will display each finished calculation as a kind of floating history on the screen. While limited to the user's input in this iteration, the displayed calculations history could be easily expanded to also show other users' input or to store the calculations objects in a database, e.g. for use in research on consumer usage patterns. It was certainly more of a challenge this way, but also a lot of fun. I spent additional effort to add optimization for various screen-sizes.  

Try it out! Your calculations await to be recorded!
