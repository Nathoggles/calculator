# OOPish Calculator
Simple yet fully functioning calculator project I did to summarize and recap my JavaScript basics. It's level of OOPness is admittedly quite light; however, I did treat each calculation as a standartized object consistently, which allowed me to hone my skills on working with objects, but which also allowed me to add a feature that slightly sets the webapp apart from countless other calculators: it will display each finished calculation as a kind of floating history on the screen. While limited to the user's input in this iteration, the displayed calculations history could be easily expanded to also show user users' input as well as to store the calculations objects in a database, e.g. for use in research and analytics on consumer usage patterns. Such an approach required more complexity than simply to pass inputted numbers to functions, but it was also a great challenge and great fun to work on reducing that complexity. The webapp is also optimized for various screen sizes. Try it out!
